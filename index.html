    <h4>House Blend Coffee</h4>

    <p>
        The degree to which a coffee bean is roasted is one of the most important factors that determine the taste of the coffee. Unroasted beans (green in color) are put into a roaster and exposed to a high level of heat. When the bean “cracks,” it loses its outer coating and releases the flavor of the bean. The longer the bean roasts, the darker and stronger the bean becomes. When the roasting is complete, the beans can be blended and ground to create distinct flavors and brews.

    <p>
        French roast coffee is one of many coffee roasts named for a regional roasting style. It was popular throughout much of Europe around the turn of the 19th century. Today, the term is used most often when describing almost any dark-roasted coffee.
