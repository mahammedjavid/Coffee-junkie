    <h4>About us</h4>
    <p>
        Coffee Junkiez was established in the late fall of 2005 by Jasan Julius.  After attending a Coffee Expo in Seattle, Washington about a decade earlier;  Jasan then moved forward with his vision of creating a brand that he saw as having a national potential based on serving non-alcoholic caffeinated beverages via small drive-thru operations.  While he wanted to make sure that the business foundation was based on industry standards, he very much wanted to be different than the crowd and has definitely broken a few rules and created some new standards.  While the business and brand have encountered many challenges, we have achieved many awards and recognitions in our home town of Kokomo, The City of Firsts, which have validated the vision of being one of the best in the industry, and doing it our own way!
